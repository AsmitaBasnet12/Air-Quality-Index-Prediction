Air Quality Index Prediction

This repository contains a project focused on predicting the Air Quality Index (AQI) using machine learning techniques. The project leverages environmental data to build a predictive model that estimates AQI values, enabling better insights into air quality and aiding in environmental planning and public health initiatives.

Features

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparation of raw data for model training.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understanding the relationships and patterns in the dataset.

Model Development: Implementation of machine learning models to predict AQI.

Model Evaluation: Assessment of model performance using appropriate metrics.

Visualization: Graphical representation of data, results, and insights.

Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

Python 3.8 or above

Jupyter Notebook or a similar IDE

Required Python libraries (see requirements.txt)
Usage

Data Preparation:

Place the dataset in the data/ directory.

Run the preprocessing scripts in the src/ directory or the provided notebooks in the notebooks/ folder.

Model Training:

Use the notebooks or scripts to train the model.

Evaluate the performance using metrics such as RMSE, MAE, or RÂ².

Visualization:

Generate plots and visualizations to analyze results and interpret the model.

Results

The results include predicted AQI values, model performance metrics, and visualizations. Details are available in the results/ directory and project notebooks.Contact
