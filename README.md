Air Quality Index Prediction

This repository contains a project focused on predicting the Air Quality Index (AQI) using machine learning techniques. The project leverages environmental data to build a predictive model that estimates AQI values, enabling better insights into air quality and aiding in environmental planning and public health initiatives.

Features

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparation of raw data for model training.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understanding the relationships and patterns in the dataset.

Model Development: Implementation of machine learning models to predict AQI.

Model Evaluation: Assessment of model performance using appropriate metrics.

Visualization: Graphical representation of data, results, and insights.
